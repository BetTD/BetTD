### BetTD

Systems administrator by day... and also by night. I am part of the DevOps Team at Sparked Host, I help manage the
infrastructure and actively participate in development work too.

I have good knowledge of the Linux ecosystem, and have worked primarily with Ansible for automation, although I've
also made my own shell scripts in certain scenarios where I had to run a (sometimes very) simple task across many
servers.

As for development, I've primarily worked with Java, PHP, and JavaScript. I also have experience with TypeScript,
more specifically when in use with the React framework, and have worked with Laravel too. All of the technologies
mentioned in this paragraph except for Java are used in the Pterodactyl project, more specifically the panel, and
knowing them has allowed me to also contribute code to Sparked Host's fork of said project, the Apollo Panel.

I know this isn't as fancy like the profiles of my teammates (hello Harry), but I hope it gives a good explanation
of what I do.
